Quadratic Sieve Implementation

Please use the notebook named "Quadratic Sieve Jupyter", which is the final notebook.
Our implementation assuming n is the product of exactly two primes; i.e. n = pq.
The current code generates B-smooth numbers for 13-16 digits within good time (minutes, max)
There are possible bugs which lead to even some x not congruent plus or minus y being generated
but not leading to factors of n!
We hope to fix that soon.
Enjoy factoring.
